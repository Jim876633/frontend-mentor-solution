### What I learned

Use `grid-template-areas` to respond different media device layout.

```css
.main {
    grid-template-areas:
        "banner"
        "title"
        "info"
        "news"
        "reading";
}
@media (min-width: 768px) {
    .main {
        grid-template-areas:
            "banner banner news"
            "title info news"
            "reading reading reading";
        grid-auto-columns: 1fr;
    }
}
```
